## Lab Environment

This lab uses DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) and other intentionally vulnerable applications for educational purposes.

⚠️ **WARNING**: These techniques should only be used in controlled lab environments or authorized penetration testing engagements.

## Getting Started

1. Set up your lab environment using the provided setup guides
2. Work through each module sequentially
3. Document your findings using the provided templates
4. Review the mitigation strategies for each vulnerability type
